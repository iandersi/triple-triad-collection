## About Triple Triad Collection

This is my first bigger ReactJS project. I made this app to learn how to use React more diversely.

Originally an app to keep track of owned cards.
Currently, an attempt at making a Triple Triad clone.

The game is somewhat playable, but currently the opponent AI is very simple. It's like playing chess with a chicken but worse... so yeah, this is still quite a work in progress.
